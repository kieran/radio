# VHF / UHF radio stuff

Mostly a config for my Baofeng UV-5R radios in Victoria BC.

## CHIRP radio config for the BC coast

CHIRP onfig in [`bc-coast.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kieran/radio/main/bc-coast.csv)

| Channel(s) | description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | NOAA weather station in Blaine WA - probably the most applicable one to Victoria (where I live) |
| 1-28 | Marine VHF channels, intended for easy use as a backup boat VHF radio |
| 60-74 | More marine VHF channels |
| 77-88 | Yet more marine VHF channels |
| 101-122 | GMRS Channels (each mapped to the GMRS channel + 100) |

### Channels worth mentioning
| Channel(s) | description |
| --- | --- |
| 16 | International distress + calling channel (monitor this on the boat) |
| 21 | Continuous Marine Broadcast (similar to NOAA weather, but for Canada?) |
| 66 | BC Marinas channel |
